*What I enjoyed while building this app:* I really enjoyed creating the different style elements! From choosing a font and usuing the Google Fonts API to exploring the ColorHunt.io libraries of color collections. Those style elements were really cool to dig into. 

**What I struggled with while building this app:** Picking fonts and colors! Who knew it could take so much deliberation! 

**Things I learned through building this app:** Color theory and other basic UI/UX design elements. I had never thought about how serif versus sans-serif fonts subconsciously register in our brains, or how colors do the same and interact with each other.
